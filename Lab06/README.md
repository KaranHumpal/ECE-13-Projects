This was the first Lab in which we used the Pickit 32. There were 5 parts to this lab in which we incorporated the LEDs, Buttons, and Switches. The important part of this lab was understanding how to call out what you want the uno32 to do and incorporate interrupts.

My approach to this lab was the same as with any lab. I spent the first couple days really reading and understanding the concepts covered on this lab. (Bit Manipulation, Interrupts, and Hardware Peripherals). Once I understood that I went on to read and understand the lab manual and start coding. This process has worked well as I have used it for the last lab. It is much better than starting the lab and learning as you go. I did not work with anyone.

I believe I was able to finish all parts of the lab. I did not however get to the extra credit portion although I think I would be able to do it if I had a little more time. I probably spent 20ish hours on this lab including all the reviewing of material for it. I really enjoyed working with the hardware and actually seeing the output, rather than on a simulator. The hardest part was learning about the hardware peripherals and how they worked. The lab manual helped alot as well as the class lectures.
