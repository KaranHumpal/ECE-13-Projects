In This lab I set up MPLABX and learned to compile and run programs using both the simulator and the UNO32.
Im not sure if I made a mistake but my UNO 32 did not connect. Im not sure if I have messed up a setting or if the actual machine is at fault. This meant I was unable to do the extra credit portion of the Lab.
