This lab was a role playing game where navigate through room files and move different directions. We used new functions like fread(), fseek(), fopen(), and fclose(). This was the first lab in which we read files not included in the code.

My approach to the lab was my usual approach which was to read the lab manual properly and know the material before starting. The lab manual however was very short and unhelpful. I believe I did it correctly. 

This lab was done under very unuasual circumstances I already emailed the profesor about. I had to rush home to see my aunt who is in her last days with breast cancer. This whole week has still felt unreal but I think Ive finished it. Regardless I need to finish Lab 9 so I did not put much time into making sure this lab was perfect.
